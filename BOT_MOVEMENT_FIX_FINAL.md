# Bot Movement Fix - Final Implementation

## Overview
Fixed the issue where bots were static and not moving. The main problems were:
1. Bot AI was only updating every 5 frames instead of every frame
2. Movement inputs weren't being consistently generated
3. Line-of-sight wasn't being checked for shooting
4. Score persistence between rounds was broken

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Bot AI Update Frequency** (`optimized_bot_ai.rs`)
- Changed from processing bots every 5 frames to EVERY frame
- Bots now make new decisions every 2 seconds but generate movement inputs every frame
- This ensures consistent movement even between decision changes

### 2. **Line of Sight for Shooting**
- Added `has_line_of_sight()` function that checks if there's a clear path between bot and target
- Uses wall spatial index to efficiently query nearby walls
- Bots only shoot when they have clear line of sight
- Skips destroyed destructible walls properly

### 3. **Enhanced Movement Logic**
- Always move forward when bot has a target position
- Added zigzag movement (10% chance) for more realistic behavior
- Flag carriers sprint with less zigzag (5% chance) for better objective play
- Tactical combat movement: strafe at close range, retreat when too close

### 4. **Improved CTF Behavior**
- More aggressive role distribution: 60% attack, 25% defend, 15% flexible
- Bots properly chase enemy flag carriers
- Bots protect friendly flag carriers
- Better coordination with counting teammates at each objective

### 5. **Combat Improvements**
- Weapon-specific shoot ranges (Shotgun: 150, Sniper: 800, Others: 400)
- 70% chance to shoot when in range with line of sight
- Melee attacks when very close (< 60 units, 30% chance)
- Reload when out of ammo

### 6. **Score Persistence Fix** (`instance.rs`)
- Modified `reset_match_state()` to NOT clear team scores
- Scores now persist between rounds as intended
- Only individual player stats are reset per round

## Technical Details

### Constants Adjusted:
```rust
const BOT_UPDATE_BATCH_SIZE: usize = 50; // Process all bots
const BOT_MOVEMENT_CHANGE_INTERVAL: Duration = Duration::from_millis(2000);
const BOT_TARGET_ACQUISITION_RANGE: f32 = 600.0;
const BOT_SHOOT_ACCURACY: f32 = 0.80;
const BOT_REACTION_TIME: Duration = Duration::from_millis(100);
const BOT_MOVEMENT_TOLERANCE: f32 = 50.0;
```

### Key Functions Added/Modified:
- `has_line_of_sight()` - Checks clear path between positions
- `generate_combat_input()` - Enhanced with proper movement generation
- `update_bots_batch()` - Now processes ALL bots EVERY frame
- `reset_match_state()` - Fixed to preserve team scores

## Testing Notes
- Bots should now move smoothly towards objectives
- Combat should feel more realistic with line-of-sight checks
- CTF gameplay should be more strategic with proper role distribution
- Scores should persist between rounds

## Performance Considerations
- Line of sight checks use spatial index for efficiency
- Processing all bots every frame has minimal impact due to optimized logic
- Wall queries are limited to small radius (5.0 units) for performance

This implementation provides a good balance between realistic bot behavior and server performance.
