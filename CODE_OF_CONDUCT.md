# The Not-So-Boring Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

*(Because even coding super-scalable servers should be a good time!)*

## Our Pledge (No, really, we mean it!)

We, as the magnificent members, contributors, and slightly-less-sleep-deprived leaders, hereby pledge to make participating in our community an experience that's free of harassment. Seriously. For everyone. That means regardless of your age (unless you're a time traveler, then things get complicated), body size (we love all data structures, big and small), visible or invisible disability (your unique OS is welcome), ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression (be your awesome self!), level of experience (n00bs to ninjas, all aboard!), education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance (rock that bedhead, we're coding!), race, religion (or lack thereof, or if you worship the Flying Spaghetti Monster), or sexual identity and orientation.

We also pledge to act and interact in ways that build an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and generally non-toxic community. Think of it as good network hygiene.

## Our Standards (aka "How to Be Awesome Here")

Examples of behavior that contributes to a fantastically positive environment for our community include:

* **Demonstrating empathy and kindness:** Basically, don't be a jerk. Try to imagine walking a mile in someone else's (possibly ill-fitting) shoes.
* **Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences:** Not everyone uses the same IDE or tabs vs. spaces. It's okay. We can still be friends.
* **Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback:** "Your code is elegant!" is great. "Your code looks like a squirrel typed it during an earthquake, but here's how we can fix line 42..." is also valuable, if delivered kindly. And if you're on the receiving end, remember, it's about the code, not your soul.
* **Accepting responsibility and apologizing:** If you accidentally `git push --force` to main, own it, apologize, and let's learn from it. We've all been there (some of us more often than others).
* **Focusing on what is best for the community:** Think "we" before "me." Unless "me" really wants pizza, then maybe we can discuss.

Examples of unacceptable behavior (aka "Don't Be *That* Person"):

* **The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind:** This isn't that kind of server. Keep it professional, folks.
* **Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks:** If you wouldn't say it to your grandma (assuming your grandma is a nice lady), don't say it here.
* **Public or private harassment:** Seriously, just don't. It's not cool, and it's a quick way to get booted.
* **Publishing others' private information (doxing):** Super not okay. Privacy is a thing. Respect it.
* **Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting:** Use your common sense. If it feels off, it probably is.

## Enforcement Responsibilities (The "We're Not Kidding" Part)

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying these standards and will take appropriate, fair, and sometimes sigh-inducing corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. We'd rather be coding cool stuff, but we'll do what's necessary to keep this a good place.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. We'll try to explain why, unless you're *really* testing our patience.

## Scope (Where This Magic Applies)

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (GitHub, Discord, forums, carrier pigeon messages if it comes to that) and also when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces (e.g., using an official project email, posting from the project's social media, or wearing the project's T-shirt at a conference... especially if it's a cool T-shirt).

## Enforcement (The "Uh Oh" Section)

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise "Dude, not cool" behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at **[INSERT CONTACT METHOD - e.g., conduct-reports@trebuchet.network or a private channel for the Benevolent Dictators of Decency]**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated with the promptness of a well-optimized algorithm and the fairness of a balanced binary tree.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. We're not about drama; we're about solutions.

## Enforcement Guidelines (The Nitty-Gritty Consequences)

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines when deciding how to deal with someone who's forgotten how to be awesome:

### 1. Correction (The Gentle Nudge)

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome. Like using `goto` in modern code.
**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, explaining why the behavior was a bit off-key. A public "my bad" might be requested if it was a public oopsie.

### 2. Warning (The Slightly Sterner Nudge)

**Community Impact**: A single oof-moment or a series of minor "are you serious?" actions.
**Consequence**: A warning with a "don't do it again, or else..." vibe. No interaction with the people involved for a bit. This includes DMs, carrier pigeons, and smoke signals. Break these terms, and you're heading for a timeout.

### 3. Temporary Ban (The "Go Sit in the Corner" Timeout)

**Community Impact**: A serious whoopsie-doodle regarding community standards, or persistently forgetting the "be awesome" part.
**Consequence**: A temporary ban from hanging out with us. No public or private chats, no PRs, no nothing for a specified time. If you try to sneak back in, you might find the ban becomes less temporary.

### 4. Permanent Ban (The "You Are a Rogue Packet We Must Drop" Ejection)

**Community Impact**: Consistently acting like a denial-of-service attack on community harmony, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassing someone, or generally being a menace.
**Consequence**: A permanent ban. You're out. No more community interaction for you. We'll miss the good you *could* have done, but we value a healthy network.

It's a great CoC, even if we did add a few dad jokes.
