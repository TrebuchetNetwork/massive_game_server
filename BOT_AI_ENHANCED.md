# Bot AI Enhancement Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Bot Movement
- Bots now have 3 behavior states:
  - **Engaging (40%)**: Aggressive combat, moves to center, shoots frequently (70% chance)
  - **Flanking (30%)**: Strategic side movement with moderate shooting (50% chance)
  - **Patrolling (30%)**: Random map movement with defensive shooting (30% chance)
- Dynamic strafing and movement patterns
- Erratic close-range combat movement
- Occasional backward movement and dodging

### 2. Combat Capabilities
- **Shooting**: Bots now shoot based on their behavior state
- **Weapon Switching**: Randomly switch between weapons 1-4
- **Reload Management**: Auto-reload when out of ammo
- **Melee Attacks**: 5% chance during close combat
- **Aim Inaccuracy**: 20% aim offset for realistic combat

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Process 10 bots per frame (increased from 5)
- Behavior changes every 1.5 seconds
- Lightweight decision making

## Testing the Bots

1. Start the server:
```bash
cd massive_game_server/server
cargo run --release
```

2. Connect with a client to see bots in action

## Known Issues

If bots aren't moving, it's likely due to the game loop freezing when players connect. The bot AI is working correctly, but the entire simulation stops due to blocking network operations.

## Next Steps

To fix the game loop freeze:
1. Make broadcast operations non-blocking
2. Add timeout to network operations
3. Ensure game loop continues even if broadcast fails
