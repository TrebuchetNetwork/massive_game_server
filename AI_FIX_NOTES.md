# AI System Fix Notes

## Issue
The game was hanging at Frame 6 when the AI update task started. The logs showed:
```
[Frame 6] Starting task: ai_update
[Frame 6] Starting task: network_input
[Frame 6] Finished task: network_input
```
But no "Finished task: ai_update", indicating the AI system was blocking the game loop.

## Temporary Fix
Disabled the AI update in `server/src/server/instance.rs` in the `run_ai_update` method:
```rust
pub async fn run_ai_update(&self) {
    let delta_time = TICK_DURATION.as_secs_f32();
    if false { // Temporarily disabled - AI was causing game loop to hang
        BotAISystem::update_bots(self, delta_time);
    }
}
```

## What This Means
- The game will now run past Frame 6
- Bots will spawn but won't move or make decisions
- Human players can still connect and play
- All other game systems (physics, networking, etc.) will work normally

## Next Steps to Fix AI Properly
The issue is likely in `BotAISystem::update_bots` in `bot_ai.rs`. Possible causes:
1. Infinite loop in pathfinding or decision making
2. Deadlock when accessing shared resources
3. Expensive computation blocking the async runtime

To debug:
1. Add more detailed logging to narrow down where in the AI update it hangs
2. Check for any blocking operations that should be async
3. Look for potential deadlocks in the bot AI logic
4. Consider running AI updates in a separate thread pool

## Running the Game
The game should now run without hanging. You can test it with:
```bash
cd massive_game_server/server
cargo run --release
```
